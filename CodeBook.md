The created R script (run_analysis.R) performs the data clean up:

    It merges the training and test sets to create one data set that calculates the 
    measurement of the mean and standard deviation. In the second part of the analysis, 
    the data set calculates the average of each activitiy and each subject.
    
    Here is the list of the activity list:
